Start use case at process start (AKA update use case scenario)
Employees can't see employee page - Admin/Manager can ? IDK MAD CONFUSING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Actually be "IN" the project 
Projects page for only projects im on 
Employees Page
Groups Page
EmployeeGroups need reference to Manager
Get rid of managers and project managers table 
Project needs references to Project manager 
If changing manager is also project lead?
	-admin needs to be aware that some update will happen to that manager
